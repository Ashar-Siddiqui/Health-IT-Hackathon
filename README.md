# Health-IT-Hackathon
Code used in Health-IT-Hackathon
In this Hackathon, we learned to use HTML to create useful webpages and websites. My basic HTML code is shown in this repository.
This HTML code displays a very basic website to the user. There is a spot to type in your name at the very top left of the wepbage. In addition to this, some images are present on the webpage.
